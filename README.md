## About

<table><tr><td>

We intend on creating a recipe sharing platform for all foodies, representing people with different expertise levels. This is a backend API that allows users to upload and share recipes, search for recipes by ingredients or cuisine, and rate and comment on recipes. The API would require a persistence layer to store recipe data and user information. Additionally, read and write operations would be used for creating and fetching recipes and user profiles. The motive behind this project is to inspire and connect individuals with different cultures and people around the world.
