Detailed descriptions of edge cases and transaction flows:

- If the user tries to create a profile with an email that already exists, the system should return an error message indicating that the email is already in use.
- If a user tries to upload a recipe with incomplete information, such as missing ingredients or instructions, the system should return an error message indicating that the recipe is incomplete.
- If a user tries to search for recipes with an invalid search query, such as a non-existent ingredient, the system should return an error message indicating that the search query is invalid.
- If a user tries to rate a recipe without providing a rating value, the system should return an error message indicating that the rating value is required.
- If a user tries to rate a recipe multiple times, the system should only update the rating for that recipe with the most recent rating provided by the user.
